<p><em>Editor’s Note: Looking for creative ways to improve your days when you work from home? This post, originally published in September of 2020, is full of helpful tips that are still just as relevant today.</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p>Work styles are a very personal thing. What works for one person may be an absolute nightmare for the next.</p>



<p>I’ve worked in advertising for a decade now, and if you’d asked me a year ago I would have told you I pretty much had things figured out. I’m a morning person (a five-thirty meeting? No thank you!). My brain can only be in one place at a time (no podcasts for me, please!). And I work best in the office or a coffee shop with lots of people buzzing around.</p>



<p>Then, COVID-19 hit. I was working from home with only my husband. My anxiety skyrocketed, and my regular 6 a.m. alarm slowly crept to 7, and then 8. My productivity tanked. I was back to square one.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I’ve completely transformed everything I ever knew about work. I have been forced to examine my faults, find new routines, and learn ways to cope and grow as a professional.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Over the last six months, I’ve completely transformed everything I ever knew about work. I have been forced to examine my faults, find new routines, and learn ways to cope and grow as a professional.<br><br>Someday, I’ll look back to 2020 and remember a lot of anger, a lot of stress, and a lot of sadness. But I’ll also see a lot of personal growth. I hope you can do the same.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Here are eight tips to improve your days when you work from home.</h2>
</div></div>

<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
<p>When you walk into any local running store, you&#8217;ll be greeted with a brightly colored wall displaying hundreds of shoes. It goes without saying that selecting the best-fitting shoe among a plethora of options is a difficult task. To add to the confusion, not every shoe is suitable for you. Regardless of the pair you pick, it must fit properly from heel to toe and feel comfortable throughout your normal running stride.</p>



<p>Most of us prefer to purchase online these days, but there is a higher danger of purchasing something you haven&#8217;t tried on</p>

<p>Most of us prefer to purchase online these days, but there is a higher danger of purchasing something you haven&#8217;t tried on. Fortunately, most stores provide a risk-free trial period, allowing you to lace up your shoes and go for a test run just as you would in the store. (Just double-check the return policy and retain the box in case you need to exchange sizes or send them back.)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How Your Shoes Should Fit</strong></h2>



<p>Each component of the running shoe has a distinct role and is tailored to suit the foot in a certain way. Even the tiniest difference can have an impact on your experience. We&#8217;ve broken down the essential components of a running shoe, so you can easily identify them and make sure they&#8217;re all the right size for your foot. (If you want to understand more about the anatomy of a running shoe, go here.)</p>

<p style="font-size:18px">The ship was making her way steadily through small waves which slapped her and then fizzled like effervescing water, leaving a little border of bubbles and foam on either side. The colourless October sky above was thinly clouded as if by the trail of wood-fire smoke, and the air was wonderfully salt and brisk. Indeed it was too cold to stand still. Mrs. Ambrose drew her arm within her husband&#8217;s, and as they moved off it could be seen from the way in which her sloping cheek turned up to his that she had something private to communicate.  They followed her on to the deck. All the smoke and the houses had disappeared, and the ship was out in a wide space of sea very fresh and clear though pale in the early light. They had left London sitting on its mud. A very thin line of shadow tapered on the horizon, scarcely thick enough to stand the burden of Paris, which nevertheless rested upon it. They were free of roads, free of mankind, and the same exhilaration at their freedom ran through them all. </p>

<p>Whole-wheat toast with nut or seed butter, banana and cinnamon. A slice of whole-wheat toast with your choice of something like peanut, almond or sunflower seed butter topped with slices of banana and a sprinkling of cinnamon is a great pre-workout snack. It gives you simple and complex carbs, is easy to digest, increases your potassium levels (which drop when you sweat) and stabilizes your blood sugar.</p>



<p>Apple slices and yogurt peanut butter dip. Mix nonfat vanilla Greek yogurt with peanut or almond butter to make a dip that&#8217;s perfect for apple slices. Consider adding grapes or raisins for an extra kick of energy.</p>

<p>Heart-healthy cereal. Pour yourself a serving of whole-grain cereal mixed with uncooked oatmeal, slivered almonds and chopped dates. Add low-fat milk or almond milk and you&#8217;re good to go.<br>Half of a lean protein sandwich on whole-wheat bread. Make yourself a sandwich with chicken, turkey or lean roast beef on whole-wheat bread for a great mix of carbs and protein. Veggies like lettuce, tomato or spinach will add nutrients.<br>Smoothie. The best thing about smoothies is that they&#8217;re portable and easy to customize. Blend sliced fruit, Greek yogurt and some granola or oats for a thicker consistency, and consider add-ins like protein powder, kale or peanut butter.</p>

<p>The paleo diet is a popular eating trend, but it&#8217;s not the best plan for everyone. Our registered dietitians explain the diet, the health benefits it can provide, and the health risks it can bring.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile is-image-fill"><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is the paleo diet healthy?</h2>



<p>Long-term studies don’t offer much information on how the paleo diet affects health. However, the diet has the potential to be a healthy way of eating. The typical paleo diet focuses on naturally raised meat and fish, as well as vegetables and fruits. It promotes avoiding dairy products and grains.</p>



<p>This diet can put you at risk for deficiencies in calcium and vitamin D, which are critical to bone health. At the same time, you may consume saturated fat and protein far above recommended levels due to eating so much meat. This can cause an increased risk of kidney and heart disease and certain cancers.</p>
