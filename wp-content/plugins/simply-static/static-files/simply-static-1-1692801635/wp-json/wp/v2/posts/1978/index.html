(Okay fine, a pile of blankets does wonders, too.) We\u2019re talking rich, aromatic chicken tikka masala over rice, fall-apart-y cabbage as inviting as a cashmere sweater, soups so soothing it warms your soul as much as your belly\u2014and oh, tons of carbs. This is not the time to pretend like you want to eat a bright, zingy salad. You don\u2019t. The heart knows what it wants, so do yourself a favor, and get cooking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food is a crucial topic to master in conversation. You&#8217;ll not only have meaningful talks with native English speakers if you have a good food vocabulary, but you&#8217;ll also be able to learn about their culture via food.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When you\u2019re fending off the feels (you&nbsp;know&nbsp;the ones), the only thing that\u2019s really proven to help is lots and lots&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":3665,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[8],"tags":[17],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1978"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1978"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1978\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3665"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1978"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1978"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1978"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
