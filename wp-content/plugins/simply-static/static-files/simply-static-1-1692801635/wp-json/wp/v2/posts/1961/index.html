Cortisol continues to diminish after peaking at 8:30 a.m. but increases again around noon. As a result, the hours of 9:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. may be the best for getting the most out of your caffeine\/coffee usage. Although cortisol levels decline in the afternoon, it&#8217;s definitely not the greatest time to get another cup of coffee because it may disrupt your sleep later in the day. Hemp Oil might help you get the most out of your coffee. Both caffeine and stress can raise cortisol levels. Caffeine in excess can cause unfavorable health consequences linked with persistently increased cortisol levels (as in chronic stress). Small to moderate doses of caffeine, on the other hand, might improve your mood and give you a boost.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Early morning coffee is also known to interfere with your natural morning cortisol production and stress your adrenal glands if&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":3360,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[13,8],"tags":[16],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1961"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1961"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1961\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3360"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1961"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1961"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1961"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
