<p>They followed her on to the deck. All the smoke and the houses had disappeared, and the ship was out in a wide space of sea very fresh and clear though pale in the early light. They had left London sitting on its mud. A very thin line of shadow tapered on the horizon, scarcely thick enough to stand the burden of Paris, which nevertheless rested upon it. They were free of roads, free of mankind, and the same exhilaration at their freedom ran through them all.</p>



<p>The ship was making her way steadily through small waves which slapped her and then fizzled like effervescing water, leaving a little border of bubbles and foam on either side. The colourless October sky above was thinly clouded as if by the trail of wood-fire smoke, and the air was wonderfully salt and brisk. Indeed it was too cold to stand still. Mrs. Ambrose drew her arm within her husband&#8217;s, and as they moved off it could be seen from the way in which her sloping cheek turned up to his that she had something private to communicate.</p>

<p>If you’re worried that dietary changes alone might not be enough to keep your bones strong, talk to your healthcare provider. Together you can discuss options for supporting bone health and preventing osteoporosis.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Step up your fish intake for brain function</h2>



<p>The impact of fish intake on brain function has been a popular area of research over the last several decades. Most recently, a 2020 analysis of over 7,000 participants found that higher fish intake was associated with higher brain function and slower rates of mental decline. A separate 2017 study of over 500 children found that “frequent fish consumption was related to both fewer sleep problems and higher IQ scores.”</p>



<p>Try to enjoy two or more servings per week of higher Omega-3 and lower mercury fish such as salmon, anchovies, sardines and freshwater trout. Experts suggest baking or broiling when preparing the fish.</p>
