That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean put away all sweaters and coats, because as we know spring can be very fickle. But there are a few tricks to making those winter-looks more spring friendly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Transitional Coats: Last week I talked about transitional coats, and these are the perfect items to add into your wardrobe right now. Lightweight, but will still keep you warm on a cool night.<br>Spring Sweaters: Layer with a transitional coat, or wear on its own, some of your winter sweaters are easy to wear into spring. I lived in these cashmere sweaters from Everlane all winter, and I know I&#8217;ll be pairing them with skirts and shorts for spring.<br>Pumps instead of Boots: I&#8217;ve traded in my boots for pumps. Keeping my feet warm isn&#8217;t a priority anymore, so it&#8217;s time to break out my favorite heels and pair back to effortless denim. These pumps have been worth the investment &#8211; I wear them the most during spring.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:auto 57%\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Transitional Coats: Last week I talked about transitional coats, and these are the perfect items to add into your wardrobe right now.
