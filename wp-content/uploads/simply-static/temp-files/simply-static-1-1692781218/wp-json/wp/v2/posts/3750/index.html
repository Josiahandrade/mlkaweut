If everything goes well, India&#8217;s Chandrayaan-3 will land on the moon at 6:04 PM local time on Wednesday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chandrayaan&#8217;s lander &#8216;Vikram&#8217; is scheduled to land near the moon&#8217;s south pole. The South Pole of the Moon is still unknown.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Chandrayaan-3 succeeds, India will be the first country to reach the mysterious South Pole of the Moon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far the former Soviet Union, the United States and China have successfully landed spacecraft on the lunar surface. If Chandrayaan-3 is successful, India will be the fourth country on this list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around the same time, Russia sent the Luna-25 spacecraft to land on the Moon&#8217;s south pole. However, the Russian spacecraft crashed on the moon last Saturday. This resulted in the failure of Russia&#8217;s first lunar mission in 47 years. The Indian spacecraft is going to try to land on the south pole of the moon within a few days of this incident.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, India sent Chandrayaan-2 to land near the South Pole of the Moon. But the campaign failed. So now all eyes are on Chandrayaan-3.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chandrayaan-3 was launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Center in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, India on July 14. The lander of Chandrayaan-3 is named &#8216;Vikram&#8217;, the rover is named &#8216;Pragyan&#8217;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, the lander &#8216;Vikram&#8217; will land on the southern part of the moon. If Vikram successfully lands, it will release the rover named &#8216;Pragyan&#8217;. This rover will carry out scientific research by going around the chest of the moon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) chief Sridhara Panikar Somnath said he is confident that Chandrayaan-3 will be able to successfully land on the moon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ISRO has announced plans to broadcast the landing live. Millions of people are expected to watch this live broadcast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>India is waiting to make history.
