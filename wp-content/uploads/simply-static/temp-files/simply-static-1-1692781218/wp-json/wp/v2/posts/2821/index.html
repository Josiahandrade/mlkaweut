What works for one person may be an absolute nightmare for the next.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve worked in advertising for a decade now, and if you\u2019d asked me a year ago I would have told you I pretty much had things figured out. I\u2019m a morning person (a five-thirty meeting? No thank you!). My brain can only be in one place at a time (no podcasts for me, please!). And I work best in the office or a coffee shop with lots of people buzzing around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, COVID-19 hit. I was working from home with only my husband. My anxiety skyrocketed, and my regular 6 a.m. alarm slowly crept to 7, and then 8. My productivity tanked. I was back to square one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I\u2019ve completely transformed everything I ever knew about work.

I have been forced to examine my faults, find new routines, and learn ways to cope and grow as a professional.<br><br>Someday, I\u2019ll look back to 2020 and remember a lot of anger, a lot of stress, and a lot of sadness. But I\u2019ll also see a lot of personal growth.

It goes without saying that selecting the best-fitting shoe among a plethora of options is a difficult task. To add to the confusion, not every shoe is suitable for you. Regardless of the pair you pick, it must fit properly from heel to toe and feel comfortable throughout your normal running stride.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of us prefer to purchase online these days, but there is a higher danger of purchasing something you haven&#8217;t tried on<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p>Most of us prefer to purchase online these days, but there is a higher danger of purchasing something you haven&#8217;t tried on. Fortunately, most stores provide a risk-free trial period, allowing you to lace up your shoes and go for a test run just as you would in the store. (Just double-check the return policy and retain the box in case you need to exchange sizes or send them back.)<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns alignwide is-layout-flex wp-container-8 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Your Shoes Should Fit<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each component of the running shoe has a distinct role and is tailored to suit the foot in a certain way. Even the tiniest difference can have an impact on your experience. We&#8217;ve broken down the essential components of a running shoe, so you can easily identify them and make sure they&#8217;re all the right size for your foot.
