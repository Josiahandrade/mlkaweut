However, the diet has the potential to be a healthy way of eating. The typical paleo diet focuses on naturally raised meat and fish, as well as vegetables and fruits. It promotes avoiding dairy products and grains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This diet can put you at risk for deficiencies in calcium and vitamin D, which are critical to bone health. At the same time, you may consume saturated fat and protein far above recommended levels due to eating so much meat. This can cause an increased risk of kidney and heart disease and certain cancers.<\/p>\n<\/div><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\" style=\"background-image:url(http:\/\/demos.ascendoor.com\/news-center\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/117\/2022\/04\/pexels-energepiccom-159888-min-1024x768.jpg);background-position:50% 50%\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/demos.ascendoor.com\/news-center\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/117\/2022\/04\/pexels-energepiccom-159888-min-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3257 size-full\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Did cave people really eat mostly meat?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>People living in the Paleolithic period, or \u201ccave people,\u201d ate whatever their surroundings offered them. When surrounded by fish or marine life, that\u2019s what they ate. In tropical habitats, people ate a variety of plant and animal foods. Calling a diet that consists mostly of protein the \u201cpaleo diet\u201d isn\u2019t accurate. Also, people living in earlier times simply didn\u2019t live to the age when chronic diseases typically emerge.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center is-image-fill\" style=\"grid-template-columns:56% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\" style=\"background-image:url(http:\/\/demos.ascendoor.com\/news-center\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/117\/2022\/04\/pexels-lisa-fotios-811587-min-1024x682.jpg);background-position:50% 50%\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/demos.ascendoor.com\/news-center\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/117\/2022\/04\/pexels-lisa-fotios-811587-min-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3285 size-full\"\/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" style=\"font-size:32px\"><strong>What&#8217;s the problem?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">Trees are more important today than ever before.
