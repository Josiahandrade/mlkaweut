Sugary cereals, pastries, bagels, along with high fat, processed meats tend to be popular breakfast food items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of these items contain refined grains and have added sugar. This could cause a rapid blood sugar spike, leading to mid-morning hunger. They also can contain a lot of extra sodium, which could affect blood pressure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research shows that having a high-fiber breakfast along with a good amount of protein and some heart-healthy fats leads to better health.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile is-image-fill\" style=\"grid-template-columns:49% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\" style=\"background-image:url(http:\/\/demos.ascendoor.com\/news-center\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/117\/2022\/04\/pexels-oliver-sjostrom-1433052-min-1-819x1024.jpg);background-position:50% 50%\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/demos.ascendoor.com\/news-center\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/117\/2022\/04\/pexels-oliver-sjostrom-1433052-min-1-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3283 size-full\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Start with breakfast cereal<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t have a lot of time in the mornings, a high-fiber cereal with low added sugar can provide your body with a good start to the day. Buy cereals with at least 5 grams of fiber.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many breakfast cereals have added protein to help pump up your protein intake. These cereals are often made from whole grains, which give your body many vitamins and minerals such as iron and folic acid.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p>Aim to purchase cereals that are made from 100% whole grains to get the most fiber.

The consensus is yes, breakfast is important and what you choose for breakfast is even more important.<br>Keep in mind, a study was published a few years ago that breakfasts high in refined sugars and carbohydrates can do more damage than good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>UC Davis Health registered dietitian Melinda Gong helps you make sense of the breakfast debate.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" style=\"font-size:24px;line-height:1.3\"><strong><a href=\"#\"> Can breakfast make you gain weight?  \u2197<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some evidence shows that eating breakfast may lead to eating a few more calories in a day. It\u2019s important to balance calories throughout the day. If you choose to eat breakfast, divide your food intake (calories) evenly between all your meals.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Breakfast foods to eat and avoid Many studies on breakfast foods have one over-arching theme: what you eat for your&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":3282,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[7,10],"tags":[15],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2051"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2051"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2051\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3282"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2051"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2051"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/mlkaweut\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2051"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
